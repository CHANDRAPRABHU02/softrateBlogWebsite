      <h1>LATEST GADGET</h1>

      <h2>1. Ekster Parliament Smart Wallet:</h2>

      <p>
        The Ekster Parliament is a smart bifold wallet with RFID coating (to
        protect against identity theft) and a patented mechanism that ejects
        cards from its aluminum storage pocket with the press of a button. It
        has space for at least 10 cards, as well as a strap for carrying cash
        and receipts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ekster has crafted the wallet from high-quality leather that comes in a
        multitude of colors. An optional Bluetooth tracker for the wallet is
        also available — this ultra thin gadget has a maximum range of 200 feet,
        and it is powered by light, so it never needs a battery.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Zyllion Shiatsu Back and Neck Massager :</h2>

      <p>
        There's nothing better than a good massage — except for a good massage
        that never has to end. This shiatsu massager can be used at home or even
        in the car (!) and is great for the shoulders, back, calves, and more.
        Bonus: It not only kneads, but also heats muscles for extra relief.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Philips Somneo Sleep and Wake-Up Light</h2>

      <p>
        The Philips Somneo is an elegant and feature-packed sleep and wake-up
        light. It can simulate a natural sunrise and sunset, play a plethora of
        soothing sounds, and even charge a smartphone via a built-in USB port.
        <br />
        We like the touchscreen interface of the lamp — it's incredibly
        intuitive to use.
      </p>
      <h2>4. Petcube Bites 2 Pet Camera with Treat Dispenser</h2>

      <p>
        The sleek Petcube Bites 2 camera has Wi-Fi connectivity, which allows
        users to keep tabs on their pets via a smartphone app. It's capable of
        capturing or streaming Full HD video via a wide-angle lens. The gadget
        can also dispense treats — you can deploy them right from your
        smartphone while away. <br />

        Other key features of the Petcube Bites 2 include two-way audio
        connectivity, compatibility with Amazon Alexa voice commands, as well as
        the ability to send sound and motion alerts. We also like that there's
        an option to use the product to connect to a veterinarian.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Apple HomePod mini Smart Speaker</h2>

      <p>
        The palm-sized Apple HomePod mini smart speaker is also a convenient
        HomeKit hub. The sub-$100 gadget allows users to control a number of
        smart home products with Siri voice commands or directly from an Apple
        device. It is available in white or space gray.
        <br />
        When it comes to audio performance, the HomePod mini sounds great,
        considering how tiny it is. You can pair two speakers for true stereo
        sound or use multiple units in a whole-house setup.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Coway Airmega 150 HEPA Air Purifier</h2>

      <p>
        The reasonably priced Coway Airmega 150 is our favorite HEPA air
        purifier for small spaces (up to 214 square feet). It has a minimalist
        design and a reliable air filtration setup. The last-mentioned bit
        includes a HEPA and a deodorization filter, as well as a washable
        pre-filter for larger airborne particles.<br />

        Available in a trio of colors (dove white, sage green, and peony pink),
        the Airmega 150 has a compact footprint and intuitive controls. Our
        favorite is a light indicator, which changes color depending on the
        room’s air quality.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Belkin BOOST↑CHARGE PRO 3-in-1 Wireless Charger with MagSafe</h2>

        This 3-in-1 wireless charger by Belkin is the most feature-packed
        MagSafe accessory and a must-have for iPhone 12 and iPhon 12 Pro owners.
        It can simultaneously charge an iPhone, an Apple Watch, and a set of
        AirPods with a wireless charging case.
        <br />
        Available in black or white, the accessory has a sleek design with
        stainless steel bits and a build quality to match. Belkin backs it with
        a 2-year warranty.
      </p>

      <h2>8. CTYBB USB-C Car Charger</h2>

      <p>
        This impulse-buy car charger has a 55-watt USB-C port, which can power
        up most laptops. A USB-A charging connector with a maximum power output
        of 18 watts is also on board, allowing users to rapidly charge other
        gadgets.<br />

        The product has a sleek design with a metal housing and an illuminated
        LED ring. It has built-in circuitry to protect the connected devices
        that it charges surges and overheating.
      </p>

      <h2>9. WD My Passport Portable SSD (500GB)</h2>

      <p>
        The WD My Passport portable SSD has a sleek yet rugged metal housing,
        which is built to survive drops from more than 6 feet. The gadget has a
        USB 3.2 Type-C connector for blisteringly fast data-transfer speeds.
        Available in blue, gray, gold, and red with up to 2TB of storage, it
        offers a powerful encryption with password protection.
        <br />
        In addition to connecting to either a PC or Mac, the product can also
        connect to USB Type-C-compatible smartphones or tablets. Its retail
        package includes a USB-A adaptor, too.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Coral 3-in-1 UV Sterilizer and Dryer</h2>
      <p>
        Coral’s highly rated 3-in-1 UV sterilizer and dryer is a convenient
        product for the world that we live in. Equipped with two UV-C lights,
        the manufacturer claims that it can eliminate germs almost completely
        from commonly used small items after only 10 minutes. It can be used not
        only for tech gadgets, but also glasses, keys, and toys, among many
        others.
        <br />
        The device has intuitive controls and a much larger capacity than a
        typical UV sanitizer. It can dry items at a warmer temperature as well.
        There’s an option to choose between sterilizing items, drying them only,
        or both.
