<h1>What cybersecurity ??</h1>
<p>Cybersecurity is the science of protecting networks, computers, programsanddata from attack, damage or unauthorized access.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Knowing what to do ---- science of cybersecurity</li>
	<li>Knowing how to do ---- engineering of cybersecurity</li>
</ul>


<p>Defining cybersecurity more technically “It is a ability to protect or defend the use of cyberspace from cyberattacks.”</p>
<p><strong>Cyberspace:</strong> It is a  global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information systems infrastructure  including the Internet, computer systems, telecommunication networks.</p>
